**Project Name:** Simple Weather Website

**Description:**

This is a basic weather website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It fetches real-time weather data from a free weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) and displays current weather conditions for a user-specified location.

**Key Features:**

- Dynamic weather data retrieval using JavaScript's `fetch` API.
- User-friendly interface to enter a city name or use geolocation.
- Clear and concise display of current weather information:
    - Location (city and country)
    - Temperature (in Celsius and Fahrenheit)
    - Weather description (e.g., "Clear skies", "Light rain")
    - Wind speed and direction (optional)
    - Weather icon (optional)
- Responsive design for optimal viewing on various devices.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:**
    - A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text)
    - A basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
    - A free API key from a weather service like OpenWeatherMap ([https://openweathermap.org/](https://openweathermap.org/))

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-weather-website.git
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies (if using external weather icon library):**
   Follow the installation instructions for your chosen weather icon library (e.g., `npm install font-awesome`).

4. **Replace API Key:**
   In `script.js`, update `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from the weather service.

5. **Run the Website:**
   Open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You may need to run a local server using tools like `python -m http.server` to view the website locally.

**Customization:**

- You can enhance the weather information displayed (e.g., humidity, sunrise/sunset).
- Implement error handling for invalid city names or API requests.
- Integrate a geolocation API for automatic location detection.
- Create a more visually appealing and interactive user interface.
